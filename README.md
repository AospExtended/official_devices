# AospExtended OS
## Official devices application

Devices repository: https://github.com/AospExtended-Devices

Few things you should know before getting started:

### 1. Hosting

Our files are hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aospextended-rom/), you will receive access when you join the team.

### 2. Over-the-air (OTA) updates
Our system is automatic, you should not worry about updating some script, just upload the new build to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aospextended-rom/) and send a pull request with the changelog and also edit your device JSON file (**builds/your_device_codename.json**) in [this](https://github.com/AospExtended-Devices/official_builds) repository. Please read the ReadMe file on that repo.

Eg: Moto G 2015 is called **osprey**, so the device JSON file is **builds/osprey.json**

**Note:** New builds can take up to 30 minutes to appear on the site and in the OTA application.
