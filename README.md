## Official devices information

Devices repository: https://github.com/AospExtended-Devices

Few things you should know before getting started:

### 1. Hosting

Our files are hosted on our own server, you will receive access when you join the team.

### 2. Over-the-air (OTA) updates
Our system is automatic, you should not worry about updating some script, just upload the new build, md5sum and changelog to proper device location on our server. That's it.

**Note:** New builds can take up to 10 minutes to appear on the site and in the OTA application.

### 4. Build type
You need to add 'export EXTENDED_BUILD_TYPE=OFFICIAL' in your build environment so that the OTA app will be included in your build.

### 5. Device tree
Maintainers should upload their device trees on https://github.com/AospExtended-Devices
