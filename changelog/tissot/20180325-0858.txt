- Switched to oreo source based kernel
- Hal3 enabled by default (no need to use magsik module for gcam, just install gcam apk)
- DT2W is working now (atleast on my panel)
- Cleaned up few stuffs that might be the cause of reboots (Let's hope its fixed)

Note:- Don't flash using OTA app, flash it manually using TWRP. You can download the build using OTA app though,
       build must be stored in internal memory/AospExtended-Updates .
